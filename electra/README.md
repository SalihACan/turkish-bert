# Turkish ELECTRA models

We release small and base ELECTRA models for Turkish, that were trained on the same data as *BERTurk*.

> ELECTRA is a new method for self-supervised language representation learning. It can be used to
> pre-train transformer networks using relatively little compute. ELECTRA models are trained to
> distinguish "real" input tokens vs "fake" input tokens generated by another neural network, similar to
> the discriminator of a GAN.

More details about ELECTRA can be found in the [ICLR paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1xMH1BtvB)
or in the [official ELECTRA repository](https://github.com/google-research/electra) on GitHub.

# Evaluation

We train both small and base ELECTRA models for 1M steps and do intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations.
Extrinsic evaluations are done for PoS tagging and NER. During pre-training checkpoints were written
every 100k steps. For the final evaluation on downstream taks we evaluate all 10 checkpoints.
We use the same datasets for evaluation as for [*BERTurk*](https://github.com/stefan-it/turkish-bert#evaluation).

Averaged Accuracy (PoS tagging) or averaged F1-Score (NER) over 5 runs for each checkpoint is reported.
That means 50 experiments on each downstream task were performed to select the best and final checkpoint
for the model release.

* [IMST dataset](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Turkish-IMST) for 

Evaluation is done with the Hugging Face Transformers library and the [token classification](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/token-classification)
example script `run_ner.py`. We use the following hyper-parameters:

| Parameter       | Value
| --------------- | -----
| `batch_size`    | 16
| `learning_rate` | 5e-5
| `num_epochs`    | 10

# ELECTRA small

The ELECTRA small model was trained with the official implementation. The TensorBoard for ELECTRA small
can be found [here](https://tensorboard.dev/experiment/x8OO1Q6aRCyC5rkXQrEfEw).
